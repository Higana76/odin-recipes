    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple recipe taken from the BBC for how to make chocolate chip cookies.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>120g butter, softened</li>
            <li>75g light brown sugar</li>
            <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>180g plain flour</li>
            <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
            <li>beat in the egg and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool.</li>
            <li>Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
